# Native compilation and the route to §§8–8a

Status: 2026-09-30, Codex WIP over 0c09a1d in build/opus_wt.
Implementation evidence and remaining work, not a language specification.

## Resumed after Q56/Q57 documentation correction

The author has resumed implementation through §§8 and 8a after a separate
documentation checkpoint. The earlier research HOLD is withdrawn. Use the
current semantic book construction/dynamic chapters and next_core_tasks §3:
no implicit Model:fresh clone, no unknown-argument declaration fallback,
explicit reference binding with conversion before structural admission,
nonexecuting signatures, and Q57 as definition containing an empty named
Structure rather than an immediate or delayed call. Earlier typed-binding
and empty-reference experiments are not the accepted declaration contract.

The preserved worktree is detached at 6a3ac8d. Its current mixed WIP has not
passed one exact-byte full gate. The old full harness s7b108 had 105 failures;
s7b117 kernel had one failure in lmx_walk_selftest. The standalone holder-fix
probe is not a replacement kernel gate. A mistakenly started audit harness
under build/l2_harness/20260930_144410 was stopped; it has no verdict and is
not evidence. Preserve existing code WIP, integrate the documentation-only
descendant without discarding files, and obtain fresh diagnostics before
claiming any dependency complete. No build/translator process remains from
that stopped audit at the coordinator's process check.

## Acceptance

§8 requires maintained L3/L2 sources for runtime, parser, both translators,
build/test/finalize tooling. Generated L1 is allowed before C. Bootstrap once
from tracked generated C; build, test and replace the binary; repeat with the
successor. Two actual successful generations, no handwritten L1 dependency,
historical binary fallback or PowerShell/Python stage in the accepted cycle.
The old run_self_build 8/8 is only a handwritten-L1 fixed point.

§8a follows §8: post through ordinary call/admission/result semantics over the
same mailbox. T01–T26; one ask to three routes = 1 execution/1 reply/3 deliveries;
three asks to three routes = 3/3/9. No second queue, resolver or graph.

## Current repairs and evidence

- E now has the ordinary void native body/trampoline/native word.
- Native compilation does not erase the executable graph. Supported E bodies
  use l2_rw_methods_count/emit, l2_occ_expr and l2_m_width. No separate E loop.
- Send metadata is keyed by owner and source statement. Graph/native emission
  use one l2_msend helper; the root-only registry/counters were removed.
- Callable-result initializers use l2_check_call, restoring D105 admission maps.
- Typed own-reference binding uses admission, as locals/formals do. Letter
  payload extraction follows grouping and explicit reference expressions.
- Dynamic calls and named-Structure hidden inputs share typed arena-cell
  materialization. A stack pointer is not a typed address for the walker.
- Literal/dynamic size_t array indices share native load/store emission.
- The implemented-body predicate includes callable-result constructors whose
  return is attached to the result-signature Frame.

Focused evidence under build/l2_harness:

| Run | Result |
| --- | --- |
| s7b102 | 9 fixtures; reference admission still failed |
| s7b103 | 7 reference/capture fixtures passed; 10 targets including infrastructure |
| s7b104 | 5 of 6 fixtures passed; held char remained |
| s7b105 | Unknown focused-fixture name rejected; no fixture evidence |
| s7b106 | 9 graph/native/reference/capture fixtures passed; 12 targets |
| s7b107 | Dynamic index and T7 constructor passed; held char exposes Q55 |
| s7b108 | Full harness: 959 targets, 105 failed; stale root-only expectations and genuine remaining gaps must be separated |
| s7b110 | 6 focused fixtures, 9 targets passed: C99 char capture/results and range checks, signed int/size_t controls |
| s7b112 | 4 focused fixtures, 7 targets passed: char callable formal, dynamic index, two L2 OOB translation-only witnesses |
| s7b113 | Full Windows runtime kernel gate: 278 targets, 103 self-tests, no failures |
| s7b114 | Full L3 runner: 11 suites and 4-unit type budget passed |

OnlyFixture is labelled diagnostic scope and cannot certify a full gate.
The full generated/kernel/L3/docs/diff gates remain mandatory.

Changed expectations: unit_next_message_loop expects 5 by answered Q53 (inner
receiver declares another m); unit_throwing_callable expects 1,1,2 by Q44
(merge copies mutable occurrence/state, shares only the native implementation).
The s7b101 null-instance experiment was an overbroad declaration skip through
l2_root_ref_row, not proof that Model:m construction itself was broken.

## Remaining clean-kernel dependencies

### C99 primitive meaning and Array indexing (Q55 answered)

The author requires C99 target types, including plain char signedness. Remove
unsigned numeric reads of char, but retain byte-index normalization for the
intern table. Check native/walker arithmetic, admission and captured results.
Array length comes from its descriptor. L2 performs no bounds checks. L3
checks only the final flattened index against total length, not each axis;
do not add runtime dimension lengths to the base descriptor. A rectangular
Array and an Array of Arrays remain distinct. See LMX_blog/q/q55.md.

Initial Q55 WIP witness: q55_char_kernel_s2 compiles the kernel and links
lmx_walk_lt_signed_selftest; direct execution of its Windows .exe passes
268 checks, 0 failures, 0 construction errors. The Python diagnostic runner
reports a missing extensionless output even though GCC creates .exe; its
aggregate verdict is NOT a green gate. The standalone older run_walk_selftest
runner lacks lmx_call linkage and is also not a green gate. Required Windows
kernel/generated/L3 gates remain pending. Numeric getter, cross-arena intern
copy and char arithmetic promotion are tested; full conversion/call coverage
and profile range admission remain work, not a completed Q55 checklist.

Read-only source audit: length already reads the descriptor. Walker ELEM and
ELEMPUT check the final index. Native lowering currently loses the source
operation's L2/L3 level and always emits unchecked access; the test knob is
not a language-level selector. Retain the actual level before adding native
L3 checks. Rectangular flattening is absent; two nested ELEM nodes currently
mean two separate Array descriptors. l2_array_literal and l2_arr_operand also
reject static OOB indices in L2. Translation-only witnesses must not execute
undefined C accesses. Do not remove Structure-slot validation as an Array fix.

### General receiver composition (Q56)

The author's clarification supersedes the proposed Array-specific residual-type
scanner. Ordinary nested receiving expressions must share one resolution path;
`[]: []:` is not a special grammar or another Array kind. Replace the existing
shape recognizers, not just their depth limit. `length` consumes the ordinary
resolved operand. The author settled sequential paths as `a[i]\[j]\[k]`,
distinct from flat C-like `a[i][j][k]`; do not recover or infer rectangular
shape. Detailed code boundaries and
acceptance: [general receiver resolution](receiver-resolution-20260930.md).

### One complete lexical graph

Common E graph emission restores the supported subset, NOT full acceptance.

1. l2_m_kids + l2_m_steps still puts data before an operator tail. Consolidate
   unit_base+i/ns_base+rank/mres_base+r formulas into physical location helpers,
   then assign existing own_uchild/own_fchild/for_uchild metadata in source order.
   Root source is l2_cur_unit, not filtered l2_e_fields.
2. l2_emit_unit/l2_emit_local_bodies allocate canonical source control bodies,
   while l2_rw_body allocates another step-only lmx_walk_plain. Populate and
   execute the same canonical body. No field-only or step-only companion.
3. lmx_walk_body already scans mixed children and skips non-operator cells.
   No runtime execution-order/name index is needed.
4. Implement missing operator representations instead of deleting the graph
   on quiet walker refusal. Preserve lone string expressions too.
5. Capture/merge/T7 consumers must stop assuming that a prefix contains all
   data. Use common graph-copy identity handling for canonical body references.

Witnesses: lexical ordering, retained operator/literal graph after native
execution, same L3 graph executed with its native word cleared in a test, and
M\while\j resolving to the exact body executed by WHILE.

### Every statically known executable body compiled

Capturing nested methods are still stubbed by l2_emit_body_in and excluded
from native-word/trampoline emission. Existing explicit+hidden ABI suffices:

1. Emit actual bodies using l2_cap_dyn_add/l2_dyn_add and l2_emit_sig.
2. In native trampolines share l2_rw_arg_fb's resolution: supplied hidden input
   wins; absent input reads its lexical declaration through self.parent.
   Explicit formals do not acquire this fallback.
3. Share captured Structure type/admission-map lookup with native paths:
   l2_cap_arg_ns, l2_node_seg, l2_d105_emit_slot.
4. l2_mad_emit and l2_emit_mad_construct_one preserve the matching native
   implementation for unchanged bodies. Remove walker-subset prerequisites.

Use make_adder, a3_caller_binding, a3_node_path/direct, capture_struct_* and
typed-result twins, with actual native-pointer assertions. Existing success
can still be walker-only success.

PAP/T7 additionally needs the already-decided steps/merge-callable-r48.md
S2 → S4 → S3 repair: preserve full formal interface; merged values are defaults,
not removed formals. Receiving signature is an admission constraint, not
another operand. Do not attach the original native address to today's reduced
incompatible signature. Explicit y=25, y=0 and a later omitted y must give
26, 1 and the original default result 6.

lmx_graph_copy_owned preserves native, but lmx_merge_owned still clears the
result root unconditionally. The L2 spec repeats that stale blanket claim,
contrary to the semantics book/Q44. Preserve the matching unchanged body's
implementation, never blindly the first operand's address after code replacement.

## Concrete §8 route after clean-kernel

1. Make separately compiled L2 libraries actually executable: current
   l2_emit_library_wrappers sets l2_library_unit=0 and fails open.
   unit_lib_pair_a/b prove LINK/SYMBOLS only; require actual 41/42 results.
2. Fix the common runtime construction ABI: library open currently opens a
   root, root needs List, and a ported List would open another root.
   profile:runtime only suppresses polling. No List-name exception.
3. Replace lmx_list_owned and declarations with L2; link without its old body;
   run growth/removal and child/root/mail consumers.
4. Port dependency-closed runtime groups: storage/arenas/pools →
   values/arrays/graph → copy/merge/admission/calls → mail/Thread/root →
   walker/L3 interpreter. Maintained .h.lm1 also counts as handwritten L1.
5. Port current P0/owner/text; existing .lm2 fragments are not a complete parser.
   Large failed ports were removed in 01f56f3. Gate without the L1 parser oracle.
6. Port both l2trans and the L1-to-C translator; test successor translation.
7. Port buildCore/make/finalize and gate logic, not old shell-script generation.
8. Prove two self-replacements from the tracked generated-C bootstrap.
9. Implement §8a on ported ordinary call/mail/admission layers, T01–T26.
