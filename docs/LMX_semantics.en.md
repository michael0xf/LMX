**Lingvamyxa (hereafter LMX) is a language in which a program is a lexical forest of primitive arrays connected into a dynamic graph.** This organization repeats self-similarly at the level of local actors with physical memory addressing and further at the level of remote intermachine messages with composite addressing.

**Both data and executable bodies are arrays**, represented by the same simple universal structures; every executable body is a complete abstract expression.

**Typing is analytical, at the level of lexical branches.** Admitting any candidate as an argument to any expression requires analytical compatibility checking and mandatory runtime validation by unit tests specified by the receiving expression. Tested candidates and checking expressions are uniquely identified by their physical addresses.

LMX is also a grammar capable of representing both data in a complex, uniquely structured hierarchical and tabular form with intersecting sets and, in principle, any language. See the [complete grammar specification](grammar.en.md).

**Language levels.** **L0** is native code: microprocessor instructions or virtual-machine instructions. For a microprocessor, the translation chain is **L3 → L2 → L1 → C99 → L0**; for a virtual machine, it is **L3 → L0** directly. Arrows denote translation stages. **L1** is the level of the L1 language and C99, described in [L1_spec_en.md](L1_spec_en.md) and [L1_spec_ru.md](L1_spec_ru.md). **L2** is LMX itself with low-level operations. **L3** is pure, hermetic LMX.
