# Maintained L3/L2 source package

This is the selected repository source root for the existing language-owned
`manifest`, `stage-copy`, `rebuild`, and `bootstrap` route. Keep its relative
layout: `src/l2src/`, `tools/`, and `tests/`. In particular, the full suite's
`../tools/sha256.lm2` extra input is relative to `tests/`; moving that list to
`tests/l2/` without an explicit source change would break its resolution.

`inputs.list` selects 166 maintained inputs: 65 source, 34 tool and 67 test
files. `inputs.sha256` binds those exact bytes with paths relative to this
directory. Generated L1/C, headers, objects and executables are not inputs.

The selected snapshot is the source of the whole quick bootstrap boot122a
([slice260](../steps/witnesses/fix260-20261102/notes.md)): source-tp122 —
the boot121a package of [slice259](../steps/witnesses/fix259-20261102/notes.md)
with B2b-2c of the Fable line and Codex's P1-NUMERIC-KIND, tp122 (design §4.5,
revision 21: a free value received by a place with a receiving model — a
modelled own or a modelled formal — is received as a graph reference by the
one graph receive `lmx_walk_value_receive_graph` (by the actual pointee, not by
a type code) and admitted against the model at run time by the same
`implements` operation the typed program's places use; the kernel's one binary
and unary operation refuse a present operand of another kind by the named
implicit `convert`, a contextual 0 beside a reference is the null test;
[design](../optimization_design_from_fable.md)).  Relative to the previous
package, boot121a, it changes 6 selected files — the kernel module
`lmx_walk_values`, the frontend modules `l2_frontend_lower` and
`l2_frontend_emit`, `tools/build.lm2` (one kernel export), `tests/full-suite.tsv`
and the slice-259 fixture `tests/dyn/free_machine_ops.lm2` (a free pointer in a
numeric operation, the null test) — and adds the fixture
`tests/dyn/free_model_admit.lm2` (a free name bound to a graph, to a graph
without the model's fields, to a number and to a pointer to a graph, received by
a modelled own and a modelled formal), so the input list grows by one line.  The
landing is slice260, by the rule of Codex's answer to
FABLE-RESULT-S3-20261102T0100Z (the whole tested set after an actual quick
PASS). `tools/build.lm2` changed, so G0 of boot122a is the candidate's rebuilt
tool tool122 (`27707BF3…`, `rebuild tool` from the stage with boot121a's G2);
the promoted working tool is boot122a's G2 (`1B9F2BA5…`).
Input-list SHA-256: `D4F79139B5DC62F779B28912A39FAA8CD7C8224C84091E38F1763CB508D511C2`.
Input-manifest SHA-256 (byte-equal to boot122a's `source-boot122a.sha256` and
to `source-tp122.sha256`):
`8F34D77F064F00E41E1012DF3973815F4921192307BC065E1DD4CE0C22B4F7A0`.

and [slice241](../steps/witnesses/fix241-20261029/notes.md).

## Normal source selection

Choose an explicit working G0 tool and its matching previous frontend,
backend and libc tuple; retain their provenance. Run each language CLI in a
fresh separate working directory, never the repository or source root.
STAGE is a new empty output root; do not prefill generated headers or bodies.
Using absolute substituted paths, the existing commands are:

```text
TOOL 0 entry 0 -- verify REPO/selfbuild/inputs.sha256 REPO/selfbuild
TOOL 0 entry 0 -- stage-copy REPO/selfbuild/inputs.sha256 REPO/selfbuild STAGE
TOOL 0 entry 0 -- bootstrap quick REPO STAGE BASE PREVIOUS_FRONTEND LABEL STAGE/tests/smoke-kernel225.tsv
TOOL 0 entry 0 -- bootstrap full REPO STAGE BASE PREVIOUS_FRONTEND OTHER_LABEL STAGE/tests/smoke-kernel225.tsv STAGE/tests/full-suite.tsv
```

Quick and full are separate requested modes, not an instruction to run both
automatically. One invocation of either builds/tests G1 and then G2 using the
actual G1 tool, promoting both. Normal generation reads staged inputs;
missing generation is a failure, not permission to reuse the older repository
headers or a cached object. Generated headers come before their consumers: the
runtime step writes the kernel's generated L1 and C headers that the smoke
list and the tool then read. The source package is authoritative; older
`dev/l2src_sandbox/`, `tools/l2/inputs/` selections and PS/Python gates are
historical inputs/routes, not an alternative fallback for this route.

boot115f selected, under the ignored `build2/codex_fix250generationchain01/`:
G0 `cold-tp115/tool115e/lmxtool-tool.exe` (`077477FD…`, the tp115 tool after
fix05, built by `rebuild tool` from this package's tool sources with boot114's
G2 frontend and runtime), previous frontend
`cold-boot114/quick114/g2/frontend/l2trans.exe` (`17DFEEA9…`, boot114's G2
frontend — the landed source-tp114's self-built frontend; tp115 changes the
frontend only in what it emits) with its adjacent backend (`93113080…`) and
libc (`AF9FDAE3…`), and BASE `cold-candidate48/full48/g2/frontend`. Its
promoted working tool is `cold-boot115f/quick115f/lmxtool.exe`
(`8C5D66EA…`), the G2 tool, with `working-bundle.sha256` equal to the G2 bundle.

## Current acceptance boundary

boot115f passed whole QUICK on these bytes from a fresh source-only stage
(2026-11-02, 06:01:02–06:17:04Z, 962 s): `BOOTSTRAP quick 0 failures`. G0
built and tested G1 (frontend, runtime, the 9-row smoke list with 0 failures,
tool) and promoted it; the actual G1 tool built and tested G2 the same way,
and G2 was promoted. Every program of the smoke list runs the driver's
start-up self-check of the code links (38 checks on a private arena)
before its own main. Quick runs neither the full list, the OS walk witness
nor the self-test, and does not compare the generations; FULL has not run on
these bytes (the full100 line's G1 passed the full list on its own sources,
this package without the tp112–tp115 changes; its G2 was stopped, slice250).
Compared from the receipts, 245 of the 248 paths hashed in both generations
are byte-equal — every frontend, backend and kernel L1, both C translation
units, the runtime objects, libc and the tool's L1 and C — and the three
executables differ only in the PE link stamp (TimeDateStamp, CheckSum). That
comparison is its own evidence, not a reproducibility gate. The previous
attempt on the tp115 sources before fix05, boot115d, passed the same way on
the frozen source-tp115 `7E6203F5…` and is the evidence of those bytes only
(Codex's review of them opened the two defects fix05 closes). The draft79
line's open items (V63, the split-pointer place, the bare return) are not
closed by this result.

Publishing these bytes removes their sole residence in ignored WIP. It does
not by itself provide a clean-clone platform G0, prove every consumed include
or close S8.6, the clean/native/admission/source-profile debts, or the mail
API. Those remain the current [plan](../next_core_tasks_v3.md) and
[handoff](../to_opus.md).
