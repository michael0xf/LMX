# Maintained L3/L2 source package

This is the selected repository source root for the existing language-owned
`manifest`, `stage-copy`, `rebuild`, and `bootstrap` route. Keep its relative
layout: `src/l2src/`, `tools/`, and `tests/`. In particular, the full suite's
`../tools/sha256.lm2` extra input is relative to `tests/`; moving that list to
`tests/l2/` without an explicit source change would break its resolution.

`inputs.list` selects 161 maintained inputs: 65 source, 34 tool and 62 test
files. `inputs.sha256` binds those exact bytes with paths relative to this
directory. Generated L1/C, headers, objects and executables are not inputs.

The selected snapshot is the source of the whole quick bootstrap boot117a
([slice255](../steps/witnesses/fix255-20261102/notes.md)): source-tp117 —
the boot116c package of [slice254](../steps/witnesses/fix254-20261102/notes.md)
with the third semantic slice of the Fable line, tp117 (design §4.5, step
B2a: the runtime-typed free value — a free name's type is the type of the
value its nearest binding holds, read where the value is used; the kernel's
one binary operation, one reception and contextual literal
(`lmx_walk_value_bin`, `lmx_walk_value_receive`, `lmx_walk_value_lit`), the
ARG place without a static witness, every receiving place of a number
admitting through the one reception (the input place, the walker's working
cell and its result), a mismatch the implicit `convert`; the frontend's FREE
kind, the empty walked witness, the record-only native read, the dynamic
expression and the receiving funnel;
[design](../optimization_design_from_fable.md)). Relative to the previous
package, boot116c, it changes 10 selected files — the kernel module
`lmx_walk_values`, seven frontend modules (`l2_frontend_helpers`, `_values`,
`_resolve`, `_context`, `_core`, `_emit`, `_lower`), `tools/build.lm2` and
`tests/full-suite.tsv` — and adds the fixture
`tests/dyn/free_value_types.lm2` (one callee reached from int and size_t
bindings, writes through the free name, receptions into typed places, a
caught `convert`), so the input list grows by one line. The landing is
slice255, by the rule of Codex's answer to FABLE-RESULT-S3-20261102T0100Z
(the whole tested set after an actual quick PASS). G0 of boot117a is tool117
(`CFD04412…`), the promoted working tool is boot117a's G2 (`4E1D96D4…`).
Input-list SHA-256: `661F983D1F3455EB588B661083A6BB40046C671688CA09D8A9530DF88D8E8B8A`.
Input-manifest SHA-256 (byte-equal to boot117a's `source-boot117a.sha256` and
to `source-tp117.sha256`):
`FC9659DF3F4E572FE13FDC3D23488FCFA9EBD41F423A39850B78157CA52D001B`.
The previous packages: boot116c is slice254 (manifest `DC4E8C62…`; 9 files
over boot115f and one new fixture); boot115f is slice253 (manifest `48F66AF0…`; 19 files
over boot114, the input list unchanged); boot114 is slice252 (manifest `FE3FDA29…`; 6 files
over boot112 — tp113 and tp114), boot112 is slice251 (manifest `7FA43F9E…`; 15 files
over boot89 — 9 inherited from full100, 8 of tp112), boot89 is
[slice246](../steps/witnesses/fix246-20261031/notes.md)
(its tested source [slice245](../steps/witnesses/fix245-20261031/notes.md));
the original unchanged publication is [slice239](../steps/witnesses/fix239-20261029/notes.md);
candidate48 and its FULL48 run are [slice240](../steps/witnesses/fix240-20261029/notes.md)
and [slice241](../steps/witnesses/fix241-20261029/notes.md).

## Normal source selection

Choose an explicit working G0 tool and its matching previous frontend,
backend and libc tuple; retain their provenance. Run each language CLI in a
fresh separate working directory, never the repository or source root.
STAGE is a new empty output root; do not prefill generated headers or bodies.
Using absolute substituted paths, the existing commands are:

```text
TOOL 0 entry 0 -- verify REPO/selfbuild/inputs.sha256 REPO/selfbuild
TOOL 0 entry 0 -- stage-copy REPO/selfbuild/inputs.sha256 REPO/selfbuild STAGE
TOOL 0 entry 0 -- bootstrap quick REPO STAGE BASE PREVIOUS_FRONTEND LABEL STAGE/tests/smoke-kernel225.tsv
TOOL 0 entry 0 -- bootstrap full REPO STAGE BASE PREVIOUS_FRONTEND OTHER_LABEL STAGE/tests/smoke-kernel225.tsv STAGE/tests/full-suite.tsv
```

Quick and full are separate requested modes, not an instruction to run both
automatically. One invocation of either builds/tests G1 and then G2 using the
actual G1 tool, promoting both. Normal generation reads staged inputs;
missing generation is a failure, not permission to reuse the older repository
headers or a cached object. Generated headers come before their consumers: the
runtime step writes the kernel's generated L1 and C headers that the smoke
list and the tool then read. The source package is authoritative; older
`dev/l2src_sandbox/`, `tools/l2/inputs/` selections and PS/Python gates are
historical inputs/routes, not an alternative fallback for this route.

boot115f selected, under the ignored `build2/codex_fix250generationchain01/`:
G0 `cold-tp115/tool115e/lmxtool-tool.exe` (`077477FD…`, the tp115 tool after
fix05, built by `rebuild tool` from this package's tool sources with boot114's
G2 frontend and runtime), previous frontend
`cold-boot114/quick114/g2/frontend/l2trans.exe` (`17DFEEA9…`, boot114's G2
frontend — the landed source-tp114's self-built frontend; tp115 changes the
frontend only in what it emits) with its adjacent backend (`93113080…`) and
libc (`AF9FDAE3…`), and BASE `cold-candidate48/full48/g2/frontend`. Its
promoted working tool is `cold-boot115f/quick115f/lmxtool.exe`
(`8C5D66EA…`), the G2 tool, with `working-bundle.sha256` equal to the G2 bundle.

## Current acceptance boundary

boot115f passed whole QUICK on these bytes from a fresh source-only stage
(2026-11-02, 06:01:02–06:17:04Z, 962 s): `BOOTSTRAP quick 0 failures`. G0
built and tested G1 (frontend, runtime, the 9-row smoke list with 0 failures,
tool) and promoted it; the actual G1 tool built and tested G2 the same way,
and G2 was promoted. Every program of the smoke list runs the driver's
start-up self-check of the code links (38 checks on a private arena)
before its own main. Quick runs neither the full list, the OS walk witness
nor the self-test, and does not compare the generations; FULL has not run on
these bytes (the full100 line's G1 passed the full list on its own sources,
this package without the tp112–tp115 changes; its G2 was stopped, slice250).
Compared from the receipts, 245 of the 248 paths hashed in both generations
are byte-equal — every frontend, backend and kernel L1, both C translation
units, the runtime objects, libc and the tool's L1 and C — and the three
executables differ only in the PE link stamp (TimeDateStamp, CheckSum). That
comparison is its own evidence, not a reproducibility gate. The previous
attempt on the tp115 sources before fix05, boot115d, passed the same way on
the frozen source-tp115 `7E6203F5…` and is the evidence of those bytes only
(Codex's review of them opened the two defects fix05 closes). The draft79
line's open items (V63, the split-pointer place, the bare return) are not
closed by this result.

Publishing these bytes removes their sole residence in ignored WIP. It does
not by itself provide a clean-clone platform G0, prove every consumed include
or close S8.6, the clean/native/admission/source-profile debts, or the mail
API. Those remain the current [plan](../next_core_tasks_v3.md) and
[handoff](../to_opus.md).
